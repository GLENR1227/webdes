        <p>A figure-eight loop around Takhlakh Lake and past Takh Takh Meadow, ascending up a lava flow for fantastic vistas of Mount Rainier, the Goat Rocks, and Mount Adams. You can also do a lake-only loop is also possible for a much shorter and leveler hike.
            The hike starts from the day use area at Takhlakh Lake Campground, but it can also be started from TakhTakh Meadow along FR-2329 or any other road crossing on the TakhTakh Meadow Trail.
